# PRD: todo-list

## Executive Summary

A clean, minimalist personal task management application focused on essential functionality. The todo list will provide users with a simple interface to create, read, update, and delete tasks, with visual feedback for task completion rates. Built as a standalone web application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for maximum accessibility and ease of use.

## Problem Statement

Many personal task management solutions are overly complex with unnecessary features, subscriptions, or complicated interfaces. Users need a straightforward tool that helps them stay organized without the learning curve. This MVP addresses the need for a simple, beautiful todo list that works immediately without setup or accounts.

### Why Now

- No server-side components
- No external dependencies beyond localStorage
- Must work offline after initial load

### Design Constraints
- Must be visually appealing and modern
- Single page application
- No user accounts or authentication
- No cloud synchronization

### Time Constraints
- MVP development target: minimal implementation timeframe
- Priority on core functionality over advanced features
- Quick iteration based on user feedback

### Assumptions
- Users have modern browsers with localStorage support
- Users prefer simple solutions over feature-rich alternatives
- Tasks are personal and don't require collaboration
- Visual design can evolve based on user feedback

## Out of Scope

### Features Not Included
- User accounts and authentication
- Cloud synchronization across devices
- Task categories or tags
- Due dates and reminders
- Recurring tasks
- Subtasks or task dependencies
- Attachments or file uploads
- Collaborative features
- Export/import functionality
- Advanced filtering or sorting
- Task history or undo functionality
- Integration with other applications

### Technical Limitations
- No backend API or database
- No mobile app (web-based only)
- No push notifications
- No offline-first capabilities beyond localStorage
- No analytics or usage tracking

## Dependencies
